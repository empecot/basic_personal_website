	<h2>DESIGN</h2>
	<p>
	From the nomadic life of a military child, through aspirations of becoming a war correspondent, and then the surreal life of cinema production--Emily's draws inspiration from seeing the world, hearing stories and finding life's fleeting moments of transcendence. Inspired by her experiences as a mother, a wanderer and an outsider, her work conveys humility cloaked in style and whimsy.

	<p>
	Specializing in Front End Web Design, Emily seeks to provide functionality, organization and elegant simplicity.

	<p>
	Emily balances her digital life with a healthy dose of music, gardening, bicycling, kickboxing, cooking, playing with her daughter and hiking her property in the Hudson Valley.
